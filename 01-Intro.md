for anyone who's preparing for a job interview and be able to explain these concepts

lot of companies ask data structure and algorithm questions in their interviews
to see if you know how to think like a programmer.

these materials change how to think about coding  
teach how to think like a programmer and design fast and scalable algorithms.  
learn how to solve problems and write beautiful code like a professional software engineer.

use any language: focus on data structures and algorithms, not programming languages.  
use any code editor: focus on algorithm design, not tooling.

learn the art of problem solving: you have to solve problems

These exercises are popular interview questions.  
not quickly jump to solution. Do your best to solve the problem on your own  
spend time thinking about various ways to solve a problem  
activate certain parts of brain, that's what matters, not the solution.  
If you can't complete the exercise in a timely manner, don't get disappointed.
