# Course Outline

- 1st part - linear data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables
- 2nd part - non-linear data structures: trees and graphs.

This series is for computer science students to be able to explain these concepts or anyone who's preparing for a job interview.

A lot of companies ask data structure and algorithm questions in their interviews to see if you know how to think like a programmer.

materials in this series change how to think about coding
teach how to think like a programmer and design fast and scalable algorithms.

use any language
focus is on data structures and algorithms, not programming languages.
use any code editor
focus is on algorithm design, not not tooling.

this course is different you have to solve problems learn the art of problem solving.
exercises in this course are popular interview questions.  not quickly jump to solution. Do your best to solve the problem on your own spend time thinking about various ways to solve a problem activate certain parts of brain, and that's what matters, not the solution. If you can't complete the exercise in a timely manner, don't get disappointed.

this course change how you think about programming, learn how to solve problems and write beautiful code like a professional software engineer.
